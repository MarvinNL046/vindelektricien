          "question": "Can I visit someone in rehab?",
          "answer": "Most treatment facilities have scheduled visiting hours, typically on weekends. Some facilities restrict visits during the first week or two to allow patients to focus on initial treatment. Always check with the specific facility about their visitation policies."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I bring when visiting?",
          "answer": "Bring only approved items—most facilities have restricted item lists.

Not allowed: outside food, medications, electronics, or anything containing alcohol."

        },
        {
          "question": "What if my loved one doesn't want visitors?",
          "answer": "Respect their wishes. Some people need space during early recovery to focus on treatment without outside pressures. Continue showing support through approved methods like letters, and let them know you're ready to visit when they are."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I talk to someone in treatment?",
          "answer": "Focus on their progress and well-being rather than outside problems. Avoid discussing stressful topics, especially family conflicts or financial issues. Be encouraging but avoid making promises you can't keep. Let them guide the conversation about their treatment."

          "answer": "A professional assessment can determine the appropriate level of care based on substance use history, medical needs, mental health status, and support system. Most facilities offer free phone assessments. Factors include severity of addiction, history of withdrawal, and presence of co-occurring disorders."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does rehab cost?",
          "answer": "Costs vary widely: outpatient programs may cost $5,000-$10,000, standard inpatient $20,000-$30,000 for 30 days, and luxury facilities $30,000-$100,000+. Many insurance plans cover treatment under mental health parity laws. Free and sliding-scale options exist for those without coverage."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does insurance cover addiction treatment?",
          "answer": "The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act requires most insurance plans to cover addiction treatment similar to other medical conditions. Coverage varies by plan—verify your specific benefits with your insurance provider or have the treatment facility check for you."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know if a treatment center is legitimate?",
          "answer": "Look for accreditation from organizations like The Joint Commission or CARF. Verify licensing with your state's health department. Check for licensed medical and clinical staff. Be wary of facilities that guarantee outcomes or pressure you into immediate decisions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I choose a local facility or travel for treatment?",
          "answer": "Both have advantages. Local facilities allow family involvement and easier aftercare transitions. Traveling removes you from triggers and negative influences. The best choice depends on your specific situation, support system, and treatment needs."

          "question": "Is there free addiction treatment?",
          "answer": "Yes, free and low-cost treatment exists. SAMHSA's treatment locator can help find state-funded programs. Salvation Army, faith-based organizations, and some nonprofits offer free treatment. Medicaid covers treatment for eligible individuals in many states."

        {
          "question": "What does insurance typically cover?",
          "answer": "Most insurance covers detox, inpatient rehabilitation, and outpatient treatment. Coverage details vary by plan—some cover 30 days inpatient, others may cover 60-90 days. Verify your specific benefits and any prior authorization requirements."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I finance addiction treatment?",
          "answer": "Many facilities offer payment plans or work with healthcare financing companies. Options include medical credit cards, personal loans, and facility payment plans. Some facilities offer sliding scale fees based on income."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is treatment worth the cost?",
          "answer": "Studies show addiction treatment is cost-effective compared to untreated addiction. The cost of addiction—medical care, legal issues, lost productivity, family impact—far exceeds treatment costs. Treatment is an investment in health and future."

          "question": "Is inpatient treatment more effective than outpatient?",
          "answer": "Effectiveness depends on matching the level of care to individual needs. Inpatient is more effective for severe addictions, those needing medical detox, or lacking stable support systems. Outpatient works well for less severe cases with strong support. The right level of care matters more than inpatient vs outpatient."
        },

          "question": "Can I work during outpatient treatment?",
          "answer": "Yes, outpatient treatment is designed to allow work and family responsibilities. Intensive outpatient (IOP) requires more hours but often offers evening sessions. Standard outpatient is highly compatible with work schedules."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know which level I need?",
          "answer": "Factors include: severity of addiction, need for medical detox, presence of co-occurring mental health issues, stability of home environment, previous treatment attempts, and family/work obligations. A professional assessment provides personalized recommendations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I fail outpatient treatment?",
          "answer": "Struggling in outpatient may indicate need for a higher level of care. This isn't failure—it's valuable information. Many people start with outpatient and step up to inpatient if needed. Honest assessment and adjustment is part of the process."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there something between inpatient and outpatient?",
          "answer": "Yes, Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) bridge the gap with full-day treatment (5-7 days/week) while returning home at night. This provides intensive care without full residential stay. Many use PHP as a step-down from inpatient."

        },
        {
          "question": "What is enabling and how do I stop?",
          "answer": "Enabling is protecting someone from the consequences of their addiction—paying their bills, making excuses, providing housing without conditions. Stopping enabling means allowing natural consequences while still loving the person. It's painful but often necessary for them to recognize the need for help."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I do an intervention?",

        {
          "question": "How do I take care of myself?",

        },
        {
          "question": "What if they refuse treatment?",
          "answer": "You cannot force an adult into treatment (except in some emergency situations). Continue expressing love and concern while maintaining boundaries. Let them know treatment options are available when they're ready. Sometimes reaching 'rock bottom' is necessary before someone seeks help."
